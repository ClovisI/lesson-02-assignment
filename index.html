          <h2>Why RWD matters</h2>
          <p>
            Responsive web design is a theory that web developers use to ensure that a site's vital information is
            accessible across all mediums and users.  This makes sense because of the unpredictability of the web.
            Given that all "page" based formats were based off of typeset work, much of the influence and thinking
            of this era still affects the way we think about web pages.  Responsive web design is the next logical
            step in text/image based communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Responsive web design is the theory that regardless of the difference between device type/size, user
            sensory issues, internet connection, browser type, we can still accurately and actively provide the
            online resources needed by page visitors.  Web developers use Responsive Web Design to ensure that
            a site's vital information is accessible across all mediums and users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web developers use responsive web design to maintain a delightful experience for all users, regardless
            of their background or what device they use to access your content.  Responsive web design makes sense
            because of the unpredictability of the web.  The web is so open, and there are so many devices, we
            cannot easily predict what people will use to access your site.  Therefore, we must design pages that
            allow flexibility and adaptability, so that no matter who or what accesses your site, your content
            can be served to the most functional and pleasing extent.
